The best slope and intercept are computed by minimizing the chi2 calculated using both standard deviation on x and y (Deming fit). Data points are simulated using a Monte Carlo method so as to obtain the error on the fitted parameters. \r\nIf error on both x and y is not specified, error is assumed constant on y and computed. \r\nResult of the fit is by default displayed, the best fit and a hull of all the possible fits are drawn.\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\n - https://github.com/tjbtjbtjb/linfitxy\r\n - http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45711\r\n\r\nSupported platforms\r\n-------------------\r\n - Developped under MATLAB 7.13 (R2011b)\r\n - Should work under any newer release of MATLAB (no additionnal library needed)\r\n - Works with octave 3.4.0 with optim 1.0.16 package (and hopefully with newer versions)\r\n\r\nContacts\r\n--------\r\n - Tristan Beau - tristan.beau@univ-paris-diderot.fr\r\n - Julien Browaeys - julien.browaeys@univ-paris-diderot.fr\r\n\r\nLicence\r\n-------\r\n See the joined LICENCE file (BSD licence)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
